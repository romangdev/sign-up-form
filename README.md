# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This sign up form page was created using pure HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript with no additional technologies. Each file type is seperate, with index.html linking to 2 folders holding 2 images and a downloadable font. 

# Optimizations
No additional optimizations necessary at the moment. 

# Lessons Learned:
The point of this project was to brush up on HTML, CSS, and a bit a Javascript, as I've been laser focused on learning Ruby for some time. The main focus of the sign up form was to practice some additional HTML and CSS things I've learned, especially in relation to forms, more advanced ideas (such as CSS properties) and input validation. 

It was great practice to get comfortable with these languages again. The form validation... more specifically ensuring the password and password confirmation input fields were equal... was awesome Javascript practice. I'm more confident again with DOM manipulation and my ability to "Google-Fu" and solve problems. 

With so much knowledge I've picked up in relation to backend principles in languages like Ruby, I've come to realize it's literally impossible to remember every single detail about everything I've learned, especially regarding languages I haven't touched in a while. I had this experience building the form with Javascript, as there were quite a few things I'd admittedly forgotten. However, I took it as a lesson in problem solving and where to look for the right answers.

I think I'll continue to get more comfortable with not knowing/remembering every bit of syntax and intracacy of each language I learn. Because I know problem solving is the main focus, and I'll be able to quickly pick things back up.
